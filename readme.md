# CCL-v2

This is the second stab at the CCL site.

## MyST

The previous one used MyST because I was enamoured of the idea of having "live" notebooks in the site, i.e notebooks you can edit and run _in the site itself_.

This turned out to be impossible. I could not get the notebooks working. Nor was it possible to change the style or typography of the site. Documentation was incomplete and there was no technical support.

A costly mistake.

## Grease

This site is an 11ty site using the Grease template. Fast, functional, beautiful, simple.

## CCL

CCL is _Creative Coding Leiden_. Let's hope we succeed in getting this off the ground.
